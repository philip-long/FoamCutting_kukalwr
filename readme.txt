there are functions cutting,PoseControlInCIModeFixCam,PoseControlInJModeFixCam

cutting: with joint impedance control, move through a series of points defined in /Linux/x86/debug/bin/model/cuttingpoints, in the file each line define the desired Pose and Force

PoseControlInCIModeFixCam: with cartesian impedance control, move through a series of points defined in /Linux/x86/debug/bin/model/cuttingpoints, in the file each line define the desired Pose and Force

PoseControlInJModeFixCam: with joint impedance control, move to the model's original point


Before connecting the express card, type sudo modprobe acpiphp
