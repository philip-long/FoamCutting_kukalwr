#This file explains how to modify the setup to run on new versions of #linux. Ubuntu 11.04 and later

# Problems without modification:
undefined reference to clock_gettime
undefined reference to pthread_create, pthread_join etc.

#Solution
In all makefile in subfolders ensure that -lrt (real time library) is moved towards the end of the -o line (output line). This is due a linking tranisition method change basically the problem is --as-needed is now default in Ubuntu 11.10.

Secondly in the TargetDependencies.global file change -lpthread to pthread. Again this is due to the linker flag -as-needed enabled by default in ubuntu 11.10.
